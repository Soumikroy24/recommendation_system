#  Book Recommendation System (SVD++ & BPR)

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Book Recommendation System** that provides personalized book recommendations to users using two collaborative filtering algorithms:

- **SVD++ (Singular Value Decomposition++)** → trained on explicit feedback (ratings)
- **BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking)** → trained on implicit feedback (user-book interactions)

The system is built with **Flask**, and includes APIs for training, evaluation, and generating recommendations.
